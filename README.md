🌟 CHROM_rPPG_implementation 🌟

This is part of my undergrad graduation project for the Electrical Engineering Project 2102499 course.

❗️ DISCLAIMER: ❗️
I didn't develop the entire code myself. I just modified and assembled others' codes together. I have given credit to other Githubs in the last part of this README (BIG THANKS!!)!!

✨ Running the Code ✨
1. Clone/download SkinDetector at: https://github.com/pavisj/rppg-pos/tree/master/SkinDetector and place the SkinDetector folder in a place where it's compatible with your path.
2. Install all the required libraries.
3. The main code to execute is `FSM_x_CHROM.py`.
4. To validate the estimated HR, you can take a look at the `.csv` files and run `bland_altman.py` to plot all the graphs.
