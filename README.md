# 🐱 CHROM_rPPG_implementation
This is part of my undergrad graduation project for the Electrical Engineering Project 2102499 course 🎓<br>
<b style="color:pink">DISCLAIMER:</b> I didn't develop the entire code myself. I just modified and asssembled others' codes together. I had given credit to other GitHub repositories in the last part of this README (BIG THANKS!!) 🙏

To run this code, first you have to clone/download SkinDetector at: https://github.com/pavisj/rppg-pos/tree/master/SkinDetector 📥
And place the SkinDetector folder in a place where it's compatible with your path. Second, install all the required libraries 📚
The main code to execute is `FSM_x_CHROM.py` 🚀
For validating the estimated HR, you can take a look in `.csv` file and run the `bland_altman.py` to plot all the graphs 📊

Results 🎉:
