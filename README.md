# CHROM_rPPG_implementation

DISCLAIMER: I didn't develop the entire code myself. I just modified and asssembled others'codes together. I had given credit to other githubs in the BIG THANKS !!

To run this code, first you have to clone/download SkinDetector at: https://github.com/pavisj/rppg-pos/tree/master/SkinDetector
. And place the SkinDetector folder in a place where it's compatible with your path. Second, install all the required libraries 
. The main code to execute is FSM_x_CHROM.py
. For validating the estimated HR, you can take a look in .csv file and run the bland_altman.py to plot all the graphs.
