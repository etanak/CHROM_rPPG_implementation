# CHROM_rPPG_implementation

This is part of my undergrad graduation project for the Electrical Engineering Project 2102499 course.

<b style="color:red">DISCLAIMER:</b> I didn't develop the entire code myself. I just modified and assembled other people's code together. I have given credit to other GitHub repositories in the last part of this README (BIG THANKS!!)!!

## Usage

To run this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone/download SkinDetector from [this repository](https://github.com/pavisj/rppg-pos/tree/master/SkinDetector) and place the SkinDetector folder in a place where it's compatible with your path.
2. Install all the required libraries.
3. The main code to execute is FSM_x_CHROM.py
4. For validating the estimated HR, you can take a look in .csv file and run the bland_altman.py to plot all the graphs.

## Results

Here are some sample results:
